At the core of all our problems we find the collective intelligence puzzle. It is that software we forgot to write.
 
The Monkey Hive is not a solution. It is something better. It is the means by which to arive at a solution utilizing all conginive resources at disposal. It is our intelectual venturi accelerating the flow of congintive things without clogging up the pipes.

The monkey hive takes the free form chosen by someone who knows what he is doing and hammers it into a hamster track to-do lists of actionable actions then distributes the work cleverly for increased performance from upscaling thereby not just disalowing distractions but to have increased collective ability for every monkey added to the hive. The professional rails are then welded together into one long railroad from the attention starved indevidual all the way to world domination.

The engine of creation that is the monkey hive shall first be pointed at it self until such time it needs other topics for benchmarking and calibration.

The feedback loop will progressively cause the monkeys to build faith in the system. If we can demonstrate that your thoughts are important you will have and share more of them causing other monkeys thereby to imitate you thereat.

Eventually, when 8 billion sufficently calibrated and sufficently organized minds focus their attention on a single problem it will melt like a snow man fired uppon with a deathstar.

In the self-reflecting software stage we will at least be dealing with software which is a fairly understood field. Here we monkeys are at least vaguely familar with the process of feature requests, bug reports and version control. It is an admitedly weird and unsophsticated process but in the face of results worthy of some faith.

We need for you to design an aplication interface, a protocol if you like, for the Hive to interface with you. We also need you to say bad things about other such implementations. And we need for you to admit not being able to find such flaws when and where that occures (if it does) Probably preferably though the interface coined by you or the one provided in the subject. But if you find other more suitable means such creativity is applauded.

Your harsh critisim is also needed to further develop this text so that we may one day pound our chest collectively.
